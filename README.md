To create an Automatic Health Monitoring System in Java that maintains diagnosis reports and avoids repetitive diagnoses, you can follow the design below. The system will have the following functionalities:

Patient Registration: Allows patients to register their details.
Diagnosis Report Storage: Stores the patient's diagnosis reports.
Retrieve Reports: Allows retrieval of previous reports to avoid repetitive diagnosing.

Explanation:
Patient Class: Stores basic patient information (name, age, patient ID).
DiagnosisReport Class: Stores diagnosis report details, associated with a patient via patientID.
HealthMonitoringSystem Class: Manages the system's main functionality, including registering patients, adding diagnosis reports, and viewing reports.

How It Works:
Register Patient: Users can add a new patient to the system.
Add Diagnosis Report: Users can create and store diagnosis reports linked to a specific patient ID.
View Patient Reports: Users can retrieve all diagnosis reports associated with a particular patient.
This is a basic prototype; in a real-world scenario, you would likely integrate a database and implement security features, such as authentication, to make the system robust and secure.
